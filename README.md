# DataCamp projects.
          Guided and unguided projects.

DataCamp projects allow you to apply the skills you have learned in DataCamp courses. 
In each project, you will carry out an end-to-end analysis on real-world tasks using real-world tools and workflows.
In doing so, you will learn how to work with Jupyter notebooks: an open-source web application that is great for interactive data analysis.

On the side, you have a Jupyter notebook, a free, open-source web application that is great for interactive data analysis.
A DataCamp project consists of a number of tasks, and here, you have the task instructions. Your first task is easy:

 ## Guided projects.
 
 
 ## Unguided projects.
 
You can apply your coding skills to solve open-ended problems without the step-by-step tasks.
If you get stuck follow the live code-along videos to see how our expert instructor finds one of the many possible solutions.
